-- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
-- A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS)
-- SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. 
-- Relational databases,Object-oriented databases,Distributed databases,Data warehouses,NoSQL databases,Graph databases,OLTP ,
-- Document/JSON database.
-- A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known as a database management system (DBMS).
--  A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs, allowing users to retrieve, update, and manage 
--  how the information is organized and optimized. A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control of databases, 
--  enabling a variety of administrative operations such as performance monitoring, tuning, and backup and recovery.
-- Some examples of popular database software or DBMSs include MySQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server,
--  FileMaker Pro, Oracle Database, and dBASE.
-- MySQL is an open source relational database management system based on SQL. It was designed and optimized for web applications
--  and can run on any platform.
-- MySQL is RDBMS.IN RDBMS data is stored in the form of tables and there may be so many tables in database and they have relations among them.
-- TODO:in this file there may be some table_names and databases in which there data was not given but they are mentioned for sake of clarification and better understanding purpose

--syntax for creating a database
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
-- -- A specific example:
CREATE DATABASE soap_store;
-- List available databases:
show databases;
-- To drop a database:
DROP DATABASE database_name;
-- For Example:
DROP DATABASE hello_world_db;
--  creating our own tables
-- our tables has columns in them,in which each column has a distinct datatype
CREATE TABLE tablename (
  column_name data_type,
  column_name data_type
);
CREATE TABLE cats (name VARCHAR(100), age INT);
-- will show tables in that DATABASE :
SHOW TABLES;
-- will show columns in that TABLE
SHOW COLUMNS
FROM
  tablename;
-- or we can use below command both works same
  DESC tablename;
-- Dropping Tables:
  DROP TABLE tablename;
-- A specific example:
  DROP TABLE cats;
-- Be careful with the above  command ! they will delete  table itself;

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;      --this will delete information in the table ,leaving the table itself

TRUNCATE TABLE cats;


  -- INSERTING DATA:
  -- The "formula":
INSERT INTO
  table_name(column_name)

-- WORKING WITH DATA TYPES IN SQL:-
-- common datatypes are:-
-- CHAR AND VARCHAR
-- DECIMAL
-- FLOAT AND DOUBLE
-- DATE,TIME ,DATETIME
-- CURDATE,CURTIME,NOW
-- TIMESTAMP

-- CHAR VS VARCHAR:-
-- CHAR is character and VARCHAR is variable character
-- if CHAR(10) then we enter the data as 'ball' the column will take 10 bytes storage even though our mentioned string has 4 bytes value
-- if VARCHAR(10) then  we enter the data as 'ball' the column will take 4 bytes storage so it is varying according to DATABASE 
-- SO VARCHAR is prefferable to use

-- DECIMAL:-
CREATE TABLE items(price DECIMAL(5,2));                 --parameters are only 5 digits  will be displayed and with 2 digits after decimal point
 
INSERT INTO items(price) VALUES(7);                   --7.00
 
INSERT INTO items(price) VALUES(7987654);             --out of numbers
 
INSERT INTO items(price) VALUES(34.88);              --34.88
 
INSERT INTO items(price) VALUES(298.9999);            --298.99

-- FLOAT:-
-- FLOAT will round upto near values after 7 digits

INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (88.45);            --88.45

INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (8877.45);          --8877.45

INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (8877665544.45);      --8877670000

-- DATE,TIME,DATETIME
DATE - 'yyyy-mm-dd' ,TIME- 'hh-mm-ss',DATETIME-'yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss'
CREATE TABLE people (name VARCHAR(100), birthdate DATE, birthtime TIME, birthdt DATETIME);
 
INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Padma', '1983-11-11', '10:07:35', '1983-11-11 10:07:35');

-- CURDATE()--->current date,CURTIME()---->current time,NOW()--->current datetime

-- DATE MATH:-
SELECT * FROM people;
 
SELECT DATEDIFF(NOW(), birthdate) FROM people;
 
SELECT name, birthdate, DATEDIFF(NOW(), birthdate) FROM people;        --now will give present datetime

SELECT birthdt FROM people;
 
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) FROM people;             --ADDS 1 month
 
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 10 SECOND) FROM people;           --adds 10seconds
 
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 3 QUARTER) FROM people;            --adds 3 quarters
 
SELECT birthdt, birthdt + INTERVAL 1 MONTH FROM people;
 
SELECT birthdt, birthdt - INTERVAL 5 MONTH FROM people;
 
SELECT birthdt, birthdt + INTERVAL 15 MONTH + INTERVAL 10 HOUR FROM people;
Fullscreen

-- DATETIME AND TIMESTAMP BOTH ARE similar BUT TIMESTAMP has a range of '1970-01-01 00:00:01' to '2038-01-19 03:14:07'


-- SOME DATE formats and methods:-
SELECT CURTIME();
 
SELECT CURDATE();
 
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(CURDATE());
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(NOW());
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%w') + 1;
 
SELECT DAYNAME(NOW());
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%W');
 
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%m/%d/%Y');
 
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%M %D at %h:%i');
 
CREATE TABLE tweets(
    content VARCHAR(140),

-- What is a NULL Value?
-- A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

-- If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

-- Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

-- How to Test for NULL Values?
-- It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

-- We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

-- IS NULL Syntax:-
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

-- IS NOT NULL Syntax:-
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;


-- HAVING:-
-- The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.
-- aggreagate functions are count(),sum(),avg(),min(),max()
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;

-- the above wont work if we replace having with where

-- The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

-- The EXISTS operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.

SELECT SupplierName                  --this query will give suppliername column if the subquery returns true and suppliername that is equal to the productname in the subquery)
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);

SELECT SupplierName              --this is same as above
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price = 22);

-- all values will be copied to new table with same schema
-- we can use where statemnet to copy specific one's only
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2,...

    WHERE ....;
-- ex:-
CREATE TABLE TestTable AS
SELECT customername, contactname
FROM customers;
-- ex2:-
CREATE TABLE TestTable2 AS
SELECT customername, contactname
FROM customers where 1=0;            --this will create new table with empty data and with the same schema

-- ALTER TABLE:-
-- The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

-- The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.

-- ADD:-
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255);

-- DROP:-
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN Email;

-- MODIFY COLUMN:-
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;

-- SQL Constraints
-- SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

-- NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
-- UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
-- PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
-- FOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table
-- CHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition
-- DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified
-- INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly

-- SQL CHECK Constraint
-- The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CHECK (Age>=18);



-- VIEWS:-
-- SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
-- In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

-- A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are
--  fields from one or more real tables in the database.

-- You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data
--  were coming from one single table.

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

CREATE VIEW Brazil Customers AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


-- if we want see the view type the below command:-
SHOW TABLES;                     --here view will also be under tables list

SHOW FULL TABLES;                 --will show the view name as 'view'

SELECT * FROM Brazil Customers;                 --will show our view(result table for our selection query)

-- insert into select:-
INSERT INTO table_name(column_list)
SELECT 
   select_list 
FROM 
   another_table
WHERE
   condition;

-- ex:-
INSERT INTO suppliers (                --suppliers table must have the all columns as same from the table it is selecting 
    supplierName, 
    phone, 
    addressLine1,

    addressLine1,
    addressLine2,
    city
FROM 
    customers
WHERE 
    country = 'USA' AND 
    state = 'CA';

-- FIELD():-
SELECT 
    orderNumber, 
    status
FROM
    orders
ORDER BY 
    FIELD(status,
        'In Process',
        'On Hold',
        'Cancelled',
        'Resolved',
        'Disputed',
        'Shipped');

-- returns the index of the status in the list 'In Process', 'On Hold', 'Cancelled', 'Resolved', 'Disputed', 'Shipped'



-- MySQL INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE example:-
CREATE TABLE devices (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO devices(name)
